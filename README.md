# CS4_Q1_Week7_LongTest

## Learning Objective

* Use previous materials, exercises, or the internet but please DO NOT give or receive help or information to or from anyone other than your teacher or groupmates. 
* Consult your teacher in class for any clarifications regarding the instructions or any problems encountered. 

## Task

A Tutee who needs to improve in a subject is able to hire a Tutor that specializes in that subject. If the condition of the needs of the Tutee matches the specialization of the Tutor, the Tutee's grade is raised by 3. Otherwise, it is only raised by 1.

## Procedure

1. Form a group of 2-3 students
1. Open a Java REPL 
2. Copy-Paste the Code Template
3. Run the code to see if it runs
4. Edit the code so that the output matches the sample run as close as possible
5. Run the code in the corresponding VPL activity for evaluation
6. Adjust your code until you get a happy score before the deadline passes
7. Have your teacher look at your work and ask individual questions about the code
8. Sign your score sheet and give it to your teacher. :)


 
### Create a Tutor class 
 Give the Tutor class fields for name (String), rate (double), earnings (double), specialization (String).
 Make a constructor for the Tutor class that has parameters for name, rate and specialization, and sets the earnings to 0.
 
 Write the following methods:
 
- getter/accessor methods for relevant fields 
- addEarnings(): adds the rate to the earnings 


### Debug the Tutee class
 Give the Tutee class fields for name (String), money (double), subject (String), grade (double), and totalTutorialSessions (int, static, set to 0).
 
 Make 2 constructors for the Tutee class that
 
- has parameters for the name, money, and sets the subject to "Math" and grade to 70 
- has parameters for the name, money, subject, and grade 

 Write the following methods:
 
- appropriate getter/accessor methods for the fields 
- consult(Tutor t): 


Given a Tutor, check the rate and if the Tutee has enough money, the consultation proceeds. 

> Print "<Tutee's name> doesn't have enough money to have a consultation with <tutor    's name>." if Tutee doesn't have enough money 

> the money of the Tutee is reduced by the rate of the Tutor and added to the Tutor's earnings and the totalTutorialSessions is increased by 1 
 
> if the Tutor's specialization is the same as the Tutee's subject, the Tutee's grade is increased by 3. It is increased by 1 otherwise. 

 > Print "<tutor's name> helped <Tutee's name> a little." if specialization doesn't match condition 

> Print "<tutor's name> helped <Tutee's name> make great progress in <Tutee's subject>." if specialization matches condition 

### Write main method 
 
 1. Create a Tutee s1 with name "Matthew" and 1000 money. 
 2. Create a Tutee s2 with name "John", 2000 money, subject "English", and grade 75 
 3. Create a Tutor t1 with name "Aaron", rate 500, and "Math" specialization 
 4. Create a Tutor t2 with name "Danica", rate 200, and "Math" specialization 
 5. Create a Tutor t3 with name "Gerson", rate 600, and "English" specialization 
 6. Create an HashMap of Tutee tuteeMap and put (s1.name, s1) and (s2.name, s2) 
 7. Create an HashMap of Tutors tutorMap and put (t1.name, t1), (t2.name, t2), and (t3.name, t3). 
 8.  Write a loop that ends when all Tutees have a grade higher than 80 or the loop has run 7 times 

 Inside the loop:

- Ask the user which Tutee will be selected 
	>Print "No Tutee named <input> is listed." if user input doesn't match 

- Ask the user which tutor will be hired by the Tutee 
	>Print "No tutor named <input> is listed." if user input doesn't match 
	
- Selected Tutee consults with selected tutor using the information given.   
 When the loop ends, display the number of consultations that occurred
